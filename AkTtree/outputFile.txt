#2: Up Up Left Down Right 5
#3: Up Up Left Down Right 5



Analysis:
#1: Using random numbers to determine where to go is horribly inefficiant. The run time can go from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, ranging from 5 to infinity. 
#2: By contrast going based upon number mismatched was much simpler, only requiring 5 moves and taking up much less space.
#3: The same can be said of the distance

The reasoning they were both the same, however, is due to the fact that the distance was 5 as well as the number mismatched. 

Giving this program actual knowledge has proven the amazingness of computer power, with a little bit of help at the start, it can solve a puzzle all on its own.
